- ## Why
  -
- ## How
  - Build-in web application cannot fetch / request the right url, it would occur CORS error: #deprecated
    - `https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?appids=2138000&cc=tr&l=en`
      - `Access to fetch at 'https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?appids=2138000&cc=tr&l=en' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8081' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.`
  - Next.JS API?
  - Inspired by [Steam上的中文Galgame丨SteamGalgame](https://steamgalgame.com/), there is a [Deals - IsThereAnyDeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/) service.
    - 内容是直接爬 Steam，价格是外挂组件更新；
      - 由 RSS（Feed）地址判断价格信息不包含在文章之内。
