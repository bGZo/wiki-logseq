- ## Remember
- After I read *[[the-little-prince]]*, I relieved I've forgotten for a long time about rite. But it's seem like when yesterday I talked about taming, rite, child or something other.
- Seem thing happened over and over again during those years, I'm always thunderstruck by my work before. I know, actually, I just put them down for a while, then they 're all gone.
- If you don't want to forget something, just do a mark, wherever you like, calendars, diaries, blogs, etc. And don't lost them. Never trust one's memory, just put them in paper, write down and try not to forget.

- ## Save Inside of Yourself
- Actually, when I read senior high school, I was always alone. Sometime I created a virtual people talking with myself, writing letter to myself. And when I write and write again, I write something I never thought before, seem like something happened naturally by logic. I never have a logic exercise and those was been called nothing matters about Chinese GaoKao....
- We know that the deep mind will show you only when you convert it to mind, (by a book???) And I like use this way to discover my deep mind and try to change my strange character.
